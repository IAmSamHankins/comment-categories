                <p class="comment-content">&quot;At the age of 82 my dad had Medicare part A and no other insurance. I begged him to sign up and pay for for part B. After a long and antagonistic argument he did so. Six months later my dad suffered from a perforated ulcer. This required hospitalization and a long course of follow up medical care. His part B insurance coverage paid for many thousands of dollars of expenses for which my dad otherwise would have been personally responsible. <br/><br/>I proudly told my dad that his part B insurance had been a great deal for him. “No”, my dad forcefully argued. He said that he had paid the part B premiums for six months before receiving any benefits. He instead should have delayed six months before signing up for part B and thus avoided paying premiums while he was in good health. My dad and I never again had a civil conversation. (He died at the age of 91.)<br/><br/>My dad’s idea and the Republican plan are to eschew insurance in favor of fee for service. But my dad could never have afforded the medical services he needed without insurance. I don’t get it, but if that’s what my fellow citizens want I ask just one thing. Let’s also repeal the Emergency Medical and Treatment Labor Act (EMTLA) passed by Congress in 1986, which explicitly forbids the denial of care to indigent or uninsured patients in emergency rooms based on a lack of ability to pay. If we are going to have fee for service, let’s do it cleanly and honestly.</p>

                    <p>This move puts the lie to all pretense that the Republicans' tax reform plans constitute middle class tax cuts. Should the mandate be repealed, any tax cut for people of modest income who are self-employed or part-time workers and get their health insurance on the exchanges or private market would more than be wiped out by the increased cost of their health insurance and health care itself. So the same Republicans who balk at using tax dollars to subsidize the health insurance of Americans of modest means have no problem raising the cost of their health care to subsidize tax cuts for the wealthy. They are morally bankrupt.</p>

                      <p>These are master strokes of legislative genius. Not only does the tax bill gut the Affordable Care Act, and potentially strip 13 million citizens of decent healthcare, but it also gives "tax cuts" to the middle class that will expire, thereby raising middle class taxes without blinking an eye. Corporations will, of course, be held harmless from these tax increases in 2025. Republican Senator's must have chuckled as they came up with these perfect solutions to passing this bill. They hold the deficit within the set limits, and solve all kinds of political issues at the same time. Of course, the middle class American worker will be stuck with worse, more expensive and less available healthcare, and they will face higher taxes in the near future, but finally, the Senate will have done something. That's a win, isn't it?</p>

                      <p>My son relies on insurance through the ACA. He spent yesterday and today trying to find coverage through the Marketplace for next year. His current carrier, Blue Cross/Blue Shield, is leaving metro Atlanta. The only two options he has are Kaiser HMO and Ambetter, which maintains his current pricing but cuts reimbursements rates to 30%, cuts covered services and quadruples deductibles to $10,000. It is, essentially, scam insurance which has been approved for sale to them most vulnerable in the state of Georgia.</br></br> The GOP Senate is happy to consign people like my son, millions and millions of them, to disease and death. My husband and I, who would pay anything if our son needed health care, could easily be facing bankruptcy. Yet we have to pay for the solid gold healthcare of our part time state legislators and the people we have sent to Congress who are smugly trying to destroy us. </br></br>All to give more tax money to the very same people who have taken over 90% of the productivity gains of the last 20 years. </br></br>How did they become so utterly dehumanized and perverse? Roy Moore has nothing on these people.</p>

                      <p>While Nero fiddled, Rome burns. As someone who has experienced both systems I can safely say the so-called single payer system (known elsewhere as universal healthcare) is the right solution. It's simpler, it's cheaper, it's far more transparent, and allows the country and its people to focus on other more productive and positive issues.</p>

                      <p>The cruel, heartless GOP just won't give it up. I"m 61 years old, my wife is 59 and we have bought individual health insurance policies in Mass. since the introduction of "Romneycare" ten years ago. Our current BC/BS policy is being discontinued, and a "similar" one comes with a 20% premium increase beginning Jan. 1, 2018 with a "decrease" in available medical coverage. But we live in a Blue State with two Democratic senators and all of our reps are Democrats as well, meaning, with the loss of our deductions, especially our medical deductions because we pay tremendous out of pocket costs for our disabled son, we have nowhere to turn. Our Senators and reps are tilting at windmills in the face of the Republican onslaught of outright disdain and cruelty.</p>

                      <p>I am a supporter of the ACA, and, short of moving fully into single payer, would like to see it be improved. [Side note, could we please acknowledge that single payer system doesn't have to completely eliminate private insurance? As it happens in many nations, single payer is the default system for all citizens, whereby wealthy citizens who don't want to share a room or a shorter wait for elective surgery can pay for that perk. It really doesn't have to be all or nothing.] </br></br>That being said, I was talking with our server in a diner in Indiana, and she told me that her daughter didn't make enough money to afford the premiums, but wasn't eligible for subsidies under the Indiana plan. Her daughter, not having insurance, was then faced with a $1,000 mandate, which she will now owe and have to pay off. No health insurance, and now debt. Hardship, either way. </br></br>I believe everyone should pay into the ACA, or hopefully one day, single payer system. We need to all be in this together. At the same time, I am sympathetic to those citizens who are caught in the middle of this situation..</p>

                      <p>My insurance cost through Obamacare already increased 17% from 2017 to 2018, for a plan that kept the same name and got worse, and that's before this bill even passed. I'm a healthy 40 year old woman with no preexisting conditions, living in the bluest state possible and seeing this country going to hell with these sorry excuses for human beings that somehow get such a large portion of Americans to vote for them. Incomprehensible.</p>

                      <p>So now we will see if Senators McCain, Collins, and Murkowski were serious in their votes against the prior attempt to destroy the ACA or whether they are merely Trump's lemmings, willing to intentionally destroy the health insurance of millions of Americans at the behest of an ignorant, vindictive and mentally unstable president. You cannot threat this needle kids - you are either on one side or the other. People will REMEMBER this vote - and no, you don't get to say, "Well, I figured these things wouldl get sorted out in the Conference Committee with the House."</p>

Instead they have expended heroic efforts to try and hurt the American people. When will the GOP realize that basic healthcare is a right and not a privilege for those that can afford it?</p>
